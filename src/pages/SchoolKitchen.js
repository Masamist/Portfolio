            School Kitchen mobile app aims to simplify the lunch ordering process 
            and facilitate payment transactions. This user-friendly mobile 
            platform provides parents with a convenient and time-saving 
            solution for placing orders. Meanwhile, food providers interested 
            in joining the lunch order service can easily access the system, 
            update menus regularly to reflect changes in factors such as 
            seasonal availability and food market prices, and efficiently 
            manage and fulfill orders.

        <p className='txt-primary'>
          <b>Platform:</b><br />
          Since the primary users of the lunch order system are parents and caregivers, 
          the most common device used is a mobile phone. Mobile apps have many advantages:<br />
          - Enhanced user experience is optimised for mobile devices, it often has a faster loading time and seamless experience<br />
          - Push notifications to users allows order reminders<br />
          - Direct access to service which enables reduction of steps within the tasks compared to navigating through a website<br />
          Therefore, cross-mobile app development has been chosen for this project scope.<br />
        </p>
        <p className='txt-primary'>
          <b>Features:</b><br />
          In the initial iteration, the following features will be included:<br />
          - Users can search meals<br />
          - Allergy information should be readily accessible<br />
          - Users can save their favourite meals for easy access<br />
          - Viewing each child's order available on both list and individual meal pages

        <p className='txt-primary'>
        This was a large-scale project that I successfully completed with a 
        classmate, we worked together to create and deploy the web application, 
        it was a significant undertaking as it would normally be assigned to a 
        team of 4 to 5 students. My roles were: business analyst, I researched 
        and created the business and solution requirements and populated each 
        document, UI designer design including mock-ups. My main role was 
        back-end developer. We decided to use React JS as our web framework 
        and Firebase for our database. I considered utilizing Node JS as the 
        back end; however Firebase has authentication including web token and 
        React hooks simplifies firebase implementation. React and Firebase are 
        a good combination for a project of this size and enabled us to complete 
        the project on a tight schedule. This was my first-time using Firebase 
        it was both challenging and rewarding.

        Overall, the project went extremely well, our team showcased our skills, 
        we learnt a lot and the client was very impressed with the web 
        application. Projects are always challenging, the code does not work 
        sometimes, the reward is resolving the issues and bugs.
